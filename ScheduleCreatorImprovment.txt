Improve your SCHEDULE CREATOR by:

EASY:

- Change the inbox in the API to inviteToSchedule, otherwise it will be confused with the actual inbox.

- Add a calendar for employees where they can mark their vacation days by clicking on the fields. The reason will appear in the fields, e.g., L4 U and others. Add a legend somewhere explaining what these symbols mean.

- Add a rule that only logged-in users can access each other's schedules. You can create a link containing the logged-in user's data when accessing the schedule – this will reduce fetching!

- Add a calendar where vacation days are visible.

DIFFICULT:

- Add an inbox for the admin where they can see current tasks and days off.

- Add a system for swapping days using drag and drop. Users can only swap their own days!

I TRIED...

THIS MAY BE EASY
- Notice that if you have, for example, 5 days fetched and 3 are not working, the add button is displayed. Make it so it's not there.

BUT IT'S NOT...
- Notice that the weekly hours limit is also bugged. It calculates it correctly, but the number picker has a problem blocking the increase of hours, etc. Also, add it to the editSchedule when someone wants to edit days.
