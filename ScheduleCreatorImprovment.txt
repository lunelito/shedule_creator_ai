Improve your SCHEDULE CREATOR by:

EASY:

- Change the inbox in the API to inviteToSchedule, otherwise it will be confused with the actual inbox.

-add a trash icon and make request to delete days in schedule (vacation,or working days)

DIFFICULT:

- Add a system for swapping days using drag and drop. Users can only swap their own days!

BUT IT'S NOT...
- Notice that the weekly hours limit is also bugged. It calculates it correctly, but the number picker has a problem blocking the increase of hours, etc. Also, add it to the editSchedule when someone wants to edit days.
